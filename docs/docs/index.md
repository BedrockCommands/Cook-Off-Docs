## üìå Project Info  

This project is powered by the [Bedrock Commands Community](https://discord.com/servers/bedrock-commands-community-924894457894174740) as part of its annual **Map Making Program**, running from **February to November**.

The **2025 winning map concept, ["Cook-Off!"](https://bedrockcommands.github.io/Cook-Off/)**, was selected through a community vote from three finalist concepts. These finalists were carefully chosen by the staff team from six original submissions by some of the community's top creators.  

This year's **Project Director** is **[@CaliFerr](https://github.com/CaliFerr)**, the author of the **Cook-Off!** concept.
