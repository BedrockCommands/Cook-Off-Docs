This project is powered by the [Bedrock Commands Community](https://discord.com/servers/bedrock-commands-community-924894457894174740) as part of its annual **Map Making Program**.  

The **2025 winning map concept, ["Cooked!"](https://bedrockcommands.github.io/Cooked/)**, was selected through a community vote from three finalist concepts. These finalists were carefully chosen by the staff team from six original submissions by some of the community's top creators.
