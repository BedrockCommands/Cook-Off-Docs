# Program Info

## Welcome to the Annual Map Making Program!! 💫

### 📋 Overview
This is a year-round event where community members collaborate on an exciting map-making project. We will be organising it for the very first time in 2025. And if this event meets successful completion, we hope to make it a tradition to host this for the community every year moving forward!

### 🎯 Objectives
- Provide a platform for talented participants to bring their amazing map concepts to life.
- Offer community members the chance to contribute and be part of a significant project.
- Create something fun and engaging for the community to look forward to!

### 📅 Deadline
The event will kick off before February and conclude in or before November, allowing approximately 10 months for development.

### 🎉 Initiation
In January, top 5 community participants from the previous year will be selected to submit their best map concepts forward. The community will vote on their favorite map concept. The winning concept will become the year’s project, with its author designated as the Project Director. *Note: To ensure manageability, only small to medium-scale concepts will be eligible for the poll.*

### 🤝 Development Process
- Project details and task lists will be shared after the voting phase. Participants can collaborate with the Project Director to complete tasks they choose to contribute to.
- The Project Director will have primary creative control, but members can suggest changes or propose additions through feedback and upvotes.
- Members are encouraged to use the server VC to live-stream their development process.

### 🏁 Conclusion
Finally, in December, we’ll host a game night to celebrate the project’s success. The completed map will also be uploaded online for **free** for everyone to enjoy! ❤️
